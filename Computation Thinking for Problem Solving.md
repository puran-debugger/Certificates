## Computation Thinking
1. Decomposition<br>
  * Purpose: breaking down or decomposing a problem into its sub-problems 
  * Approach:<br>
    * Break the problem into smaller problems by thinking about what inputs are needed to solve the problem and how to use those inputs to perform a task
    * Break the problem into a number of discrete sub-tasks by figuring out what steps are needed to solve the problem
2. Pattern Recognition
3. Data Representation 
4. Abstraction
