## Computation Thinking
1. Decomposition<br>
  * Purpose: breaking down or decomposing a problem into its sub-problems 
  * Approach:<br>
    * Break the problem into smaller problems by thinking about what inputs are needed to solve the problem and how to use those inputs to perform a task
    * Break the problem into a number of discrete sub-tasks by figuring out what steps are needed to solve the problem
2. Pattern Recognition<br>
 * Pattern recognition is finding similarities or shared characteristics within or between problems.  
3. Data Representation and Abstraction<br>
 * Determine what characteristics of the problem are important and filter out those are not. Use these to create a representation of we are trying to solve.
 * Advantage for abstracting unnecessary data<br>
   * Data takes up space
   * Unnecessary data complicatees the problem and is distracting

4. Algorithms
